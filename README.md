# HearthStone Machine Learning

## General presentation

This project is a major part of our studies [*MSC Advanced Computer Science (Computational Intelligence)*] at the University of Kent (United Kingdom).

It is about an IA (Machine Learning system) for card oriented game, applied to the game HearthStone (Blizzard company).

## Project presentation

This is an AI project (Machine Learning system) for a card game, applied to the game HearthStone (Blizzard company). Hearthstone is a digital collectible card game (and free-to-play) that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents. All played with cards that can summon creatures, weapons, spells, secrets, ...

We are interested by both artificial intelligence and the game HearthStone, that is why we would like to make our project of studies about a machine learning system, which will have the ultimate goal of learning cards and combos by itself, and be able to advise the player on what is the best move in every situation.

### Step 1: Creation of the project (January 2016)

- Writing documentations/presentations of the project
    - Moodle page: [CO880: Project and Dissertation](https://moodle.kent.ac.uk/2015/course/view.php?id=797)
    - [Project information for Students](https://moodle.kent.ac.uk/2015/mod/page/view.php?id=86182)
    - HearthStone protocol
- Find a supervisor
    - [School staff pages](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/)
    - [Prof Alex Freitas](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/aaf/index.html) - *Professor of Computational Intelligence*
- Register the project

### Step 2: Fetch HS data and simulate a game (February 2016)

- Discovery of HearthStone protocol
    - Log files (particulary the *Power.log* in the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone\Logs\`)
    - Other possibility, network packets: [Hearthy](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthy)
- Fetching, parsing and interpreting HearthStone live data
    - Possible implementation with the log files: [hearthstone.hslog](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-hearthstone/tree/master/hearthstone/hslog)
- Game simulator
    - [Fireplace](https://github.com/jleclanche/fireplace)
    - [Hearthbreaker](https://github.com/danielyule/hearthbreaker)

### Step 3: Machine Learning simple deck (March 2016)

- Creation of a basic deck
    - Basic paladin aggro
- Machine Learning (our IA vs our IA, with the same deck) using the simulation system
    - *IAMDINOSAUR*: [GitHub](https://github.com/ivanseidel/IAMDinosaur) / [YouTube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7XHzqZjXQs)
    - [Hearthbreaker](https://github.com/danielyule/hearthbreaker)
- Calculation of the percentage of winning the game

### Step 4: HUD (April 2016)

- IA vs real player (always with the same deck) during a real game (fetch live data)
- HUD printing advices/options to the player
    - With the Tk library: [POC](./POC/)
- Improvement of the IA

### Step 5: Multiple decks (May-June 2016)

- Creation of other decks
- Machine Learning of other decks
- Detection of the enemy deck

### Step 6: General machine learning (July-August 2016)

- Writing our reports
    - [Project information for Students](https://moodle.kent.ac.uk/2015/mod/page/view.php?id=86182)
- Creation of decks in live
- Machine Learning in live
